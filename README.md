# Food-Sales-Predictions
#The overall goal of this project was to find potential ways to improve the overall sales of the grocery outlets using the data provided in the dataframe.
#In my analysis of the dataset, I compared the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) based on their Item Category (Dairy, Soft Drinks, etc.)

#I looked for any oddities in the visibility of each product by category. I hoped to find some correlation between the MPR of products and their shelf visiblity to no avail.
